Welcome to our Car Price Prediction project repository! 🎉

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of cars based on various features. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze a comprehensive dataset to build a model that accurately forecasts car prices. Our goal is to provide insights into what factors influence car pricing in the market.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes detailed information about cars, such as:
- 🚘 Car Name
- 📅 Year of Manufacture
- 💵 Selling Price
- 💰 Present Price
- 🛣️ Kilometers Driven
- ⛽ Fuel Type
- 🏷️ Selling Type
- 🚦 Transmission Type
- 👤 Number of Owners

## Methodology
We employ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate our predictive models. The project focuses on accuracy and interpretability, ensuring robust predictions for potential car buyers and sellers.

## Key Features
- 📊 Data Visualization: Explore insights through charts and graphs.
- 🛠️ Model Selection: Compare and select the best model for prediction.
- 📉 Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics.

## How to Use
To run the project locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to execute different stages of the project.
